# ZombieRoad backend
This is a single player side scrolling game. Guide the puppy down ZombieRoad and avoid getting infected by zombies!

## Motivation
The purpose of this app was to become familiar with vanilla JS and event listeners. The backend is a simple Rails API that records the players' scores.

## Tech used
Rails
Postgres

## Features
- User of serializers to render JSON data
- CORS enabled to secure http requests

## Setup
- Clone down this repo and run `bundle install`.
- Once this has completed and all dependencies are installed, run `rails s`.
- Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). You'll only see the Rails welcome screen but this indicates that the http request was successful and the API is ready to serve the client.
- Now, visit the [ZombieRoad client](https://github.com/cmonkey03/ZombieRoad) and follow the setup instructions to get the ZombieRoad app's frontend running.
